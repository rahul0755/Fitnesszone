         <h2>YOGA TRANIER </h2>
          <p>
		Throughout my life I have always been surrounded by sport and exercise, this developed a passion for health and fitness and provided me with the foundations I needed to kick start my career within the industry. Now with over 6 years of experience, I have developed a huge amount of knowledge and adapted this into my own philosophy.
		 This philosophy is centred around bringing the mind and body together to work in cohesion and maximise the power of this to not only look and perform better but also to feel better within yourself.
		 testing them within my own programming so I can see for myself whether the principle is optimal and to ultimately get the best results for you! Qualifications: Level 2 gym instructor, Level 2 advanced circuits instructor.
